    "# pagerank() Function Parameters:\n",
    "# - G: The input graph (must be a directed graph).\n",
    "# - alpha: Damping factor (usually set between 0.85 and 0.9).\n",
    "# - personalization: A dictionary that assigns custom rank values to nodes (used to bias the algorithm towards specific nodes).\n",
    "# - max_iter: The maximum number of iterations the algorithm will run before stopping.\n",
    "# - tol: The tolerance for convergence. If the sum of absolute differences between iterations is smaller than this value, the algorithm will stop.\n",
    "# - nstart: A dictionary that initializes the starting PageRank values (optional).\n",
    "# - weight: The weight of the edges in the graph (default is 'weight').\n",
    "# - dangling: A dictionary to handle dangling nodes, or nodes with no outgoing edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Handling the Graph:\n",
    "# - If the graph is not directed, it is converted to a directed graph.\n",
    "# - A stochastic graph (W) is created, where each edge is normalized to form a valid transition probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initial Vector:\n",
    "# - The initial PageRank vector (x) is set either as equal distribution (if nstart is None) or from the given starting vector nstart.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Personalization:\n",
    "# - If personalization is not provided, the rank is evenly distributed across all nodes.\n",
    "# - If provided, it is normalized to sum to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Dangling Nodes:\n",
    "# - A \"dangling node\" has no outgoing edges. The algorithm handles these by redistributing their rank using the personalization vector (or a provided dangling vector).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Power Iteration:\n",
    "# - The main iterative loop performs the power iteration process to update the PageRank of each node.\n",
    "# - The rank is updated based on the previous iteration's rank and contributions from neighbors and dangling nodes.\n",
    "# - The algorithm stops when the L1 norm of the change in ranks is below the specified tolerance, or when the maximum number of iterations is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Return:\n",
    "# - The function returns the computed PageRank values if convergence is reached.\n",
    "# - Otherwise, it raises an error if convergence isn't achieved within the given iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example Use Case:\n",
    "# - A random graph is created using the Barabási-Albert model (nx.barabasi_albert_graph()), which generates a scale-free network.\n",
    "# - The pagerank() function is applied to this graph with a damping factor (alpha=0.4), and the resulting PageRank values are printed.\n",
    "# - The NetworkX built-in PageRank function is also used to verify the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "# - The pagerank() function will output a dictionary of nodes with their corresponding PageRank values.\n",
    "# - This can be useful for ranking nodes (pages) in terms of importance or centrality within a network.\n"
